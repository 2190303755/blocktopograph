A previous contributor, [@MithrilMania](https://github.com/MithrilMania), is now back.
You may want to check out [her repository](https://github.com/MithrilMania/blocktopograph).

Structures of both repos have been changed since last year, and a merge does seem too hard,
we'll contact her later and discuss about the solution. 

## Build

Clone project in Android Studio: `File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git`  
Install missing SDK components. Android Studio would give you the auto-fix options.  

### Release-Workflow

The official Google-Play version is managed by @mithrilmania. The Release-signing keys are not available.
You can build it as debug build or sign it with your own keys.

This Google-Play version will be updated after any significant and well-written feature additions and fixes.

Questions? You can reach [@protolambda on Twitter](https://twitter.com/protolambda)!

Issues and requests are welcome too, but please use the issue-tracker for this to keep things organized.
