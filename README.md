This fork is the only one supporting MCPE 1.2~1.10 for now.

## Update paused
Until next change in Minecraft level format.  
Pull requests will still be processed in time during the pause unless Meow Cat decays.  

## Download
[>>> Download on Google Play <<<](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rbq2012.blocktopograph)  
And release page of the repository provides debug version of the app.

## Help!
Would you like to together update block and entity list?  

## Build

Clone project in Android Studio: `File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git`  
Install missing SDK components. Android Studio would give you the auto-fix options.  

### Release-Workflow

The official Google-Play version is managed by @mithrilmania. The Release-signing keys are not available.
You can build it as debug build or sign it with your own keys.

This Google-Play version will be updated after any significant and well-written feature additions and fixes.

Questions? You can reach [@protolambda on Twitter](https://twitter.com/protolambda)!

Issues and requests are welcome too, but please use the issue-tracker for this to keep things organized.
